# MCPP
[![C/C++ CI](https://github.com/JordanWWood/MCPP/actions/workflows/c-cpp.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/JordanWWood/MCPP/actions/workflows/c-cpp.yml)

## Goals
TODO

## Compile
Start by cloning the repository with `git clone --recursive https://github.com/JordanWWood/MCPP.git`
If you have a version of the repo that was not cloned recursively run `git submodule update --init` to clone necessary dependencies into `vendor/` .

Download [Premake5](https://premake.github.io/). Premake is the build tool I use to generate Visual Studio solution files and gmake files.\
On windows run `<path to premake> vs2022` to generate a Visual Studio solution.
Open MCPP.sln and build
